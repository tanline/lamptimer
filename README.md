# Lamp Timer

A program to help determine the "best" time to turn on and off, the outdoor lamp, one month at a time.

The lamp is used in the evening and ideally would be turned on at dusk everyday, and turned off after 4 hours.

The reported times will be rounded to the nearest half-hour for simplicity.
